            <p>based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetic processes of biological
organisms. As the natural populations evolve according to the principles of natural
selection and “survival of the fittest” first laid down by Charles Darwin, so by simulating
this process GAs are able to evolve solutions to real-world problems, if they have been
suitably encoded (Holland, 1975). Feature selection through GA-based search along with
an ANN classifier has been used to classify “difficult-to-diagnose” microcalcifications
from mammography (Dhawan, Chitre, Kaiser-Bonasso, & Moskowitz, 1996). The use of
similar procedures has also been reported for the recognition of skin tumours and
                endothelial cells (Yamani, Khiani & Farag, 1997)</p>
           <h5>Classification</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>The role of the classification module is to decide about the inclusion of the feature vectors
appearing at its input into a category or class, among a set of predefined classes. The
development and implementation of the classification module may be based either on
supervised or unsupervised training methods.</p>
            <p>In supervised training, a set of characteristic vectors is considered, known as training
set. For each vector in the training set the class to which it belongs, is known a priori.
The vectors in the training set are used to train the classifier, which can subsequently
classify any vector appearing to its input into one of the available classes (Duda, Hart
& Stork, 2000).</p>
            <p>In unsupervised training a set of characteristic vectors is examined and the class each
vector belongs to is unknown. Classification of vectors in the available categories is done
automatically during the formation of the classifier. Subsequently, as before, each
characteristic vector is classified in one of the categories (Duda, et al., 2000).</p>
            <h6>Supervised Classification</h6>
            <p>The most common supervised classifiers include Bayes classifiers, nearest neighbour
classifiers, decision trees, and artificial neural networks (Jain et al., 2000). In Bayes
classifiers, each feature belongs to the class with the highest a posteriori estimated
probability. In nearest neighbour classifiers, features are classified based on their
relative similarity. In decision trees, classification is the result of a sequence of logical
steps.</p>
            <p>One of the most popular supervised classification methods is based on the use of ANNs,
which are computational modelling tools that have recently emerged and found extensive
acceptance in many disciplines for modelling complex real-world problems. ANNs may
be defined as structures comprised of densely interconnected adaptive simple processing elements (called artificial neurons or nodes) that are capable of performing massively
parallel computations for data processing and knowledge representation (Schalkoff,
1997). ANNs are applied to problems that cannot be described with rules or mathematical
formulas.</p>
            <p>The fundamental element of each ANN is the neuron. Each neuron is the synapse of its
inputs, i.e. the sum of the products of the inputs with appropriate weighing coefficients.The inputs can be external signals or the outputs of other neurons. Subsequently, the
sum of the inputs with the corresponding weights is transformed with a linear or a nonlinear transform function to produce the neuron output. Neurons are organised in layers.
The neurons of the input layer have only one input. The outputs of the neurons of the
input layer are conveyed to neurons of intermediate layers. The neurons of the output
layer produce the final output of the ANN.</p>
            <p>The ability to train an ANN consists in the adaption of weighs during the training process.
The most commonly used procedure for training ANNs is the feedforward errorbackpropagation learning algorithm (Haykin, 1999). According to this method, each
vector in the training set appears at the ANN input and is propagated through the
intermediate layers toward the output layer. The response of the neurons at the output
layer is compared with the desired response of each vector and the error is calculated.
Subsequently, the error is backpropagated and used to re-estimate the weight of each
neuron. The procedure is repeated for all vectors of the training set. An epoch is
completed after all vectors have been interrogated. At the end of each successful epoch
the total error, for all vectors of the training set, is reduced. The procedure continues until
a criterion for the termination of the training is satisfied.</p>
            <h5>Unsupervised Classification</h5>
            <p>The most common unsupervised classification method is C-means. A characteristic
vector, known as the class centre, is created for each class. Subsequently, each vector
is assigned to the class for which the euclidean distance from the class centre is minimal.
After all characteristic vectors are classified, the class centre is re-estimated. The
procedure is repeated until a convergence criterion is satisfied (e.g., there is no variation
in vector classification in two successive iterations, the reduction in the total euclidean
distance of the vectors from the class centres is lower than a predefined threshold). The
advantages of the method include low complexity and easy implementation. However,
the method is sensitive to the initial estimation of the class centres and, as a result,
convergence may appear at a local minimum of the euclidean distance of the vectors from
the class centres.</p>
            <p>A variation of the C-means method is the fuzzy C-means method (Bezdek, 1981). The
difference in the two methods lies in the fact that in C-means method each vector is strictly
assigned only to one class, whereas in fuzzy C-means method each vector belongs to all
classes. The percentage with which each vector belongs to a class is the member function
(Zadeh, 1965).</p>
            <p>Although ANNs are mainly supervised classifiers, unsupervised ANNs can be used to
cluster characteristic vectors. The most representative network of this category is the
Self-Organising Map (SOM) ANN (Kohonen, 1989). Characteristic vectors appear at the
ANN input and are related to the output neurons. The weights between input and output
neurons are recursively varied (training phase) until a termination criterion is satisfied.
SOMs are sensitive to the selection of the initial weights, because a sub-optimal solution
may be the result of improper initial weight selection. Furthermore, convergence is
determined by a number of parameters including the training rate and the neuron
neighbourhood where training takes place.Unsupervised classification also includes hierarchical clustering (King, 1967), clustering
using genetic algorithms (Goldberg, 1989), and so on</p>
            <h2>Diagnosis of Carotid Atherosclerosis from B-Mode
Ultrasound Images</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>B-mode ultrasound imaging of the carotid artery is widely used in the diagnosis of carotid
atherosclerosis because it allows non-invasive assessment of the degree of stenosis and
of plaque morphology. Currently, disease severity and selection of patients to be
considered for endarterectomy, that is, surgical removal of plaque, is based on previous
occurrence of clinical symptoms (e.g., stroke) and the degree of stenosis caused by the
plaque. However, there is evidence that atheromatous plaques with relatively low
stenosis degree may produce symptoms and that the majority of asymptomatic patients
with highly stenotic atherosclerotic plaques remain asymptomatic (Inzitari, Eliasziw,
Gates, Sharpe Chan, Meldrum, et al., 2000). To assist diagnosis of carotid atherosclerosis,
quantitative indices characterising plaque severity may be estimated from the analysis
of digitised ultrasound images.
</p>
            <p>More specifically, image texture analysis may be used to quantify plaque echogenicity,
and movement of the carotid artery wall and plaque may be estimated from temporal image
sequences and used as an index of plaque strain. In addition to this, automatic
classification of atheromatous plaques into symptomatic or asymptomatic using AI
techniques is expected to support decision-making about management of patients.
Plaque texture may be estimated with a number of techniques and be used as input to a
CAD system. First-order statistics have been used to characterise texture in the following
three distinct areas of a typical B-mode ultrasound image of a diseased carotid artery
(Figure 2): atheromatous plaque, blood and surrounding tissue (Golemati, Tegos,
Sassano, Nikita, & Nicolaides, 2004). First order statistical features were significantly
different in different areas of the ultrasound image. In addition to this, the fractal
dimension was estimated using the kth nearest neighbour method in 10 symptomatic and
nine asymptomatic carotid atheromatous plaques at different phases of the cardiac cycle,
namely systole, diastole and average during the cardiac cycle. As shown in Table 1, the
fractal dimension was found significantly higher in the symptomatic group (Asvestas,
Golemati, Matsopoulos, Nikita & Nicolaides, 2002). ANOVA (ANalysis Of Variance)
statistics demonstrated that the phase of the cardiac cycle had no systematic effect on
the calculation of the fractal dimension. The fuzzy c-means algorithm was applied to
classify the fractal dimension into two classes. All features corresponding to symptomatic subjects were assigned to Class 1, whereas the features of eight out of nine
asymptomatic subjects were assigned to Class 2. Furthermore, Laws texture energy
features have been estimated in 54 symptomatic and 54 asymptomatic plaques. Energy
features were significantly different between symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques
(Mougiakakou, Golemati, Gousias, Nikita, & Nicolaides, 2003b).</p>

                </center>
            <p>Automatic classification of carotid plaques into symptomatic or asymptomatic based on
texture features was achieved with a CAD system, which consists of three modules: a
feature extraction module, where texture features are estimated based on Laws’ texture
energy and first-order statistics, a dimensionality reduction module, where the number
of features is reduced using ANOVA statistics, and a classifier module with an ANN,
trained via a novel hybrid method using GAs, to recognize the type of atheromatous
plaques (Mougiakakou, Golemati, Gousias, Nikita, & Nicolaides, 2003b). The hybrid
method was able to select the most robust features, to automatically adjust the ANN
architecture, and to optimise the classification performance. The developed CAD system
achieved a total classification performance of 99 percent.
The motion of the carotid atheromatous plaque relative to the adjacent wall may be related
to the risk of cerebral events. A quantitative method for motion estimation was applied
to analyse arterial wall movement from sequences of two-dimensional B-mode ultrasound
images (Golemati, Sassano, Lever, Bharath, Dhanjil, & Nicolaides, 2003). Image speckle
patterns were tracked between successive frames using the correlation coefficient as the</p>

            <p>matching criterion. The results showed expected cyclical motion in the radial direction
and some axial movement of the arterial wall. The method can be used to study further
the axial motion of the carotid artery wall and plaque and, thus, provide useful insight
into the mechanisms of atherosclerosis.</p>
            <p>The combination of texture and motion information may be valuable for accurate
diagnosis of vascular disease. ANALYSIS, a modular software system designed to assist
interpretation of medical images may be used to analyse texture and motion from B-mode
ultrasound images of the carotid artery (Stoitsis, Golemati, Nikita, & Nicolaides, 2004).
Texture analysis allows the estimation of first-order statistics, second-order statistics
(Haralick’s method), Laws’ texture energy, and the fractal dimension using the differential box-counting method.</p>
            <p>Motion is estimated using block-matching and region tracking for rectangular ROIs along
the surface of the plaque. The following indices of motion can be estimated for each
plaque: (a) Maximal Surface Velocity (MSV) and (b) Maximal Relative Surface Velocity
(MRSV), defined as the maximum of differences between maximal and minimal surface
velocities throughout the sequence. Motion and texture features were estimated in 10
symptomatic and nine asymptomatic carotid atheromatous plaques. After dimensionality reduction, the two strongest texture features (lowest p-value) were retained, namely
standard deviation after convolution with Laws mask LTE and histogram width after
convolution with Laws mask LTE. Their average values (±standard deviations) are shown
in Table 2 together with the values of the motion features.</p>
            <h2>Differential Diagnosis of Focal Liver Lesions from CT
Images</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>One of the most common and robust imaging techniques for the detection of hepatic
lesions is CT (Taylor & Ros, 1998). Although the quality of CT images has been
significantly improved during the last years, some cases are difficult to accurately
diagnose. In these cases, the diagnosis has to be confirmed by administration of contrast
agents or invasive procedures (biopsies). In order to assist clinicians in diagnosis, and
reduce the number of required biopsies, CAD systems can be employed for the
characterisation and classification of liver tissue. A number of approaches have been
proposed based on different image characteristics, such as texture features, from
ultrasound B-scan and CT images. Texture analysis of liver CT images based on the
Spatial Gray Level Dependence Matrix (SGLDM), the Gray Level Run Length Method
                (GLRLM) and the Gray Level Difference Method (GLDM) has been used by various</p>
